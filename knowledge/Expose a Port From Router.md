# How

In order to make our application accessible from the Internet, we could create a node port service and open the specific port on our router. By doing this, we would be able to access the application using our home IP Address. 

# Why this is a Bad Idea ?

This is a bad idea, because we expose a port directly on our router. From the outside we can scan the open ports of our router and it can become a door to our network.
