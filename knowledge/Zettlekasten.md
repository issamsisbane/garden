# What is it ?

Niklas Luhmann created it.
He used a system of identifiers to link notes. 
Each notes was a small piece of paper with only 1 idea.
Creation by navigation because he encounters connection he didn't expect.
Each note is carefully wrote with own words. 

# Purpose 

A tool for thinking
Structured Notetaking
Makes writing easier
External memory

# Why ?

"Clear thinking becomes clear writing, one cannot exist without the other"
William Zinnser
Meaning, if I can't write in my own words I have not mastered the subject yet.
# How to take notes
1. Capture idea without thinking about it too much (watching a tutorial...) => **Fleeting Notes**
2. Then later, we will process these notes. We will write into our own words. It will force us to process the idea and understand it well. It will then create a **permanent note**.
## Fleeting Notes
They are : 
* Ephemeral
* Brief
* Quick capture
