**There** are three primary **cloud models** that organizations can choose from depending on their needs:

## **IAAS** (Infrastructure As A Service)

**Infrastructure As A Service (IAAS)** is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider manages the underlying **hardware** infrastructure, including **servers**, **storage**, and **networking** components. This allows businesses to rent computing resources on-demand without the need to purchase and maintain physical hardware.

- **Servers**: Virtual or physical machines that process data.
- **Storage Space**: Scalable data storage solutions.
- **Networks**: Virtual networking that connects resources and provides security.

**Example**: Amazon EC2, where you can rent virtual servers to run applications.

## **PAAS** (Platform As A Service)

**Platform As A Service (PAAS)** provides a platform that abstracts the underlying infrastructure, enabling developers to focus solely on writing code and deploying applications. The cloud provider takes care of the platform's maintenance, allowing for more streamlined development processes.

**Enables developers to**:

- **Build**: Create applications using a variety of development tools and languages.
- **Test**: Run tests to ensure application performance and reliability.
- **Deploy**: Launch applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

The provider manages:

- **Scaling**: Automatically adjusting resources based on demand.
- **Patching**: Keeping the platform up-to-date with the latest security and software updates.
- **Maintenance**: Handling routine platform management tasks, freeing up developers to focus on innovation.

**Example**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which allows developers to deploy and manage applications without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure.

## **SAAS** (Software As A Service)

**Software As A Service (SAAS)** delivers software applications over the internet on a **subscription** basis. In this model, users can access software applications from any device with internet connectivity, without worrying about installation, maintenance, or infrastructure management. The cloud provider handles everything, including software updates, security, and infrastructure.

**Example**: Netflix, where users subscribe to access a vast library of movies and series without owning or managing the content directly.
