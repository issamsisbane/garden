## What is IaC ?

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is a practice that allows developers and operations teams to **manage and provision infrastructure** through **code** rather than manual processes. Instead of using a graphical interface like the AWS Web Portal ([[ClickOps]]) or Command-Line Interface (CLI) to set up resources, IaC allows you to **define your infrastructure in code**, which can be stored in version control, shared across teams, and automatically deployed.

There are many IaC Tools such as : [[AWS - CloudFormation]], [[Terraform]], Pulumi...

## Key Benefits of IaC

### **Version Control**

Using IaC, infrastructure definitions can be stored in **version control systems** (like Git). This allows teams to track changes over time, collaborate more effectively, and revert to previous versions if issues arise.

### **Collaboration and Automation**

IaC facilitates **collaboration** across teams, enabling multiple developers to work on infrastructure changes simultaneously. Additionally, automation tools can integrate with IaC to **automatically deploy infrastructure** based on the code, reducing the need for manual intervention.

- **CI/CD Integration**: Infrastructure changes can be automatically applied as part of a **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipeline, streamlining the development and deployment process.

### **Consistency and Reliability**

IaC ensures that environments are **consistent** across development, testing, and production. Since the infrastructure is defined in code, the same infrastructure can be deployed across multiple environments without human error.

- **Example**: Whether you're deploying to a development environment or a production environment, IaC ensures that each environment is set up exactly the same, reducing inconsistencies and potential issues caused by manual configurations.

### **Faster Setup and Scaling**

IaC enables infrastructure to be **set up quickly**. With just a few lines of code, entire environments can be created, replicated, or scaled automatically. This is particularly useful for **auto-scaling** or deploying complex infrastructure with multiple services.

- **Automation**: Instead of manually setting up servers, databases, and networks one by one, you can define them in IaC and deploy them with a single command.

### **Integration with DevOps**

IaC integrates seamlessly with **DevOps practices**, making it easier to manage both code and infrastructure in a unified way. It allows for infrastructure changes to be tested and reviewed just like software code, aligning infrastructure management with the agile principles of continuous development and delivery.
