A version control is a system that helps to manage the changes to the code over the times.

it helps for retrieving realier versions
Tracks who made changes
managing modifications made by multiple people

It helps a lot for debugging and Understanding project evolution.
It allows to know who made the changes, when an why.
This is crucial in today context where a single line of code can make everything stop working just like the crowdstrike panne the few months ago.

A version control is made of 3 components : 
* a repository : its like a database storing every project files and revision to the code
* a commit : a snapshot of files in a particular point in time along with a message describing the changes
* a branch : a particular version of the repository ? used to develop features, fix bugs and safely experiment new ideas;

There are 3 types of version control systems : 
* Local
* Centralised (CVCS) : a single server containing all the versions files
* Distributed (DVCS) :
