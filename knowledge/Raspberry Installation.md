# Install the OS 

1. Put the empty SD Card in a SD Adapter
2. Put the Adapter in a computer
3. Install [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
4. Select the your raspberry type
5. Select the OS you want
6. Select you SD Card
7. Configure it by setting username & password & enabling ssh 
8. Let the software do the job

When its done you just have to launch you raspberry by powering it on.
And you should be able to access your raspberry by ssh. You'll have to get the raspberry ip address by accessing your ISF box using the app. 

You can also connect the raspberry to a monitor using an micro hdmi adapter. I thought it was mandatory to have so I bought one to eventually find out you don't need it if you use only ssh.
