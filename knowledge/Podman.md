Podman is a free & open-source alternative to [[Docker]].

Every pod run an infra container. It's a light-weight container used as an admin layer for the health of our pod.

We can define kubernetes yaml manifest to deploy pods. Which is really useful because when we want to deploy it to a kubernetes cluster we just use the file directly.
