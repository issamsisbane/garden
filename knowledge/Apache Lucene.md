# What is it ?

It's a [[Search Index]].
**Most popular Open Source Search Index.**

It supports many complex types of searching : Levenstein distance, coordinates searching... 
(more than prefix or suffix).

It's not a fully managed system and we must to do a lot to make it works.
It's normally used on a **single** node but it can be used in a **distributed systems** like [[Elastic Search]].
