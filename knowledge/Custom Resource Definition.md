# What is it ?

A pod in Kubernetes is a standard resource included with kubernetes. But we can also create Custom Resource using Custom Resource Definition. 

It is possible to use CRD by installing operator into a cluster.


# Example 
If we install the operator [[Flux]] then we can use a CRD called GitRepository.
