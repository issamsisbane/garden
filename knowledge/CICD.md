## Continuous Integration (CI)

**Continuous Integration (CI)** is the practice of **automating the integration of code changes** from multiple developers into a shared repository several times a day. Each change is automatically **tested** to ensure it doesn’t break the software. CI helps to **identify bugs early** and ensure that the codebase is always in a deployable state.

- **Key Benefits of CI**:
    - **Early Bug Detection**: By merging code frequently, teams can detect and fix bugs early, reducing the risk of finding issues late in the process.
    - **Faster Feedback**: Developers receive quick feedback from automated tests, allowing them to fix issues while they are still fresh.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)

**Continuous Delivery (CD)** is the next step after CI, where the code is **automatically prepared for release** into staging environments. CD ensures that the application is always in a **deployable state** and that **new features** or **bug fixes** can be released at any time with minimal manual intervention.

- **Key Benefits of CD**:
    - **Faster Release Cycles**: The ability to deploy code quickly and easily reduces the time between development and delivery to the end-user.
    - **Lower Risk**: Because deployments are more frequent and smaller in scope, there’s less risk of major system failures.

## Continuous Deployment

**Continuous Deployment** takes Continuous Delivery a step further by **automatically deploying every change** that passes all tests directly to production. It eliminates the need for manual approval in the deployment process.

- **Key Benefits of Continuous Deployment**:
    - **Rapid Delivery of Features**: New features and fixes are deployed to production as soon as they are ready.
    - **Reduced Manual Work**: Fully automated deployments reduce the need for human intervention, allowing teams to focus on development and innovation.

## Steps

A typical CI/CD pipeline includes a series of automated steps that take code from development to production. These steps ensure that code is continuously integrated, tested, and deployed.

### 1. Code

- Developers write and commit code to a **version control system** (e.g., Git). The CI/CD pipeline is triggered every time code is pushed to the repository.

### 2. Build

- The code is automatically **compiled** and built into executable artifacts (e.g., binaries or Docker images). The build process also checks for any issues, such as missing dependencies or broken configurations.

### 3. Test

- Automated **unit tests**, **integration tests**, and **functional tests** are run to ensure that the code behaves as expected. If any tests fail, the pipeline stops, and the developer is notified to fix the issues before proceeding.

### 4. Deploy to Staging

- Once the code has passed all tests, it is deployed to a **staging environment**. This environment mimics the production environment and allows teams to conduct additional testing, such as **performance tests** or **security tests**.

### 5. Acceptance Testing

- In the staging environment, **user acceptance testing (UAT)** is performed. This step ensures that the software meets the business requirements and functions as expected for the end-user.

### 6. Deploy to Production

- After successful acceptance testing, the code is **deployed to the production environment**. If the pipeline follows the **Continuous Deployment** model, this deployment is fully automated, and no manual intervention is required.
