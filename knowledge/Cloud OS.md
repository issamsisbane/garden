## Linux Distributions

**Linux distributions** dominate cloud environments due to their **flexibility**, **customization**, and **cost-effectiveness**. Common Linux distributions used in the cloud include:

- **Ubuntu**
- **CentOS**
- **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**

These Linux distributions are favored for their **open-source nature**, allowing for deep customization, and are often used in **high-performance cloud workloads**.

### Key Advantages of Linux in the Cloud:

- **User Friendliness**: Modern Linux distributions, especially **Ubuntu**, are designed with user-friendliness in mind, making them easier to adopt for developers and system administrators.
- **Stability**: Linux distributions like **Red Hat** and **CentOS** are renowned for their **stability**, making them ideal for **mission-critical applications** that require consistent uptime.
- **Commercial Support**: Distributions like **Red Hat** offer enterprise-level support, providing peace of mind to businesses that require professional assistance and long-term stability.

### Cost-Effectiveness

One of the most appealing aspects of using Linux in the cloud is the **absence of licensing fees**. As **open-source software**, Linux distributions offer a cost-effective solution for companies, allowing them to scale their cloud infrastructure without incurring high operating system costs.
