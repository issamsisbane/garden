NAT, or **Network Address Translation**, is a technology used in computer networks to allow multiple devices within a private local network (for example, in a home or a business) to share the same public IP address when accessing the Internet.

### How does NAT work?

1. **Private Network**: Each device in a local network has a private IP address, which is used for internal communications within the network.
2. **Public Network**: When these devices want to connect to the Internet, they must use a public IP address. Since public IP addresses are limited, itâ€™s often not possible to assign a unique public address to each device.

The router or gateway that connects the local network to the Internet uses NAT to **translate** private IP addresses into a single public IP address. This helps to mask the private addresses of internal devices, providing both efficiency and enhanced security.

### Types of NAT

1. **Static NAT**: A private IP address is permanently mapped to a specific public IP address.
2. **Dynamic NAT**: A range of public IP addresses is used to dynamically map private IP addresses when a device in the local network wants to connect to the Internet.
3. **PAT (Port Address Translation)**: A common form of NAT, also known as "NAT overload," where multiple devices share a single public IP address. Each device is distinguished by a unique port number, allowing multiple simultaneous connections to be managed.

### Advantages of NAT:

- **Conservation of Public IP Addresses**: It allows multiple devices to use a single public IP address.
- **Security**: It hides private IP addresses, making it harder for external entities to directly access devices within the local network.

### Disadvantages of NAT:

- **Application Complexity**: Some applications that require direct connections, such as certain online games or video conferencing software, may face difficulties when traversing NAT.
