# GARDEN

This is my personal garden; it contains all the things I learn in my daily job or through my extracurricular activities. The concept of this garden is inspired by the [Zettlekasten](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).

This repository will only retain the global knowledge I possess, common procedures, or problems I have encountered. It allows me to share this knowledge across my different workstations without the fear of leaking any private client or company data.

## Content 

- ASSETS : contains the images screenshots and logos
- KNOWLEDGE : contains all my notes
- RESOURCES : contains the resources I find interesting

## Linked to Portfolio

My Garden is linked to my portfolio, meaning that I can write articles and blog posts from here, and they will be uploaded automatically thanks to GitHub pipelines.
